# JASKL settings (https://github.com/Almighty-Satan/JASKL)
# If you want to use JASKL, insert the version and implementation here.
# If you don't want to use JASKL, leave at least one of the options empty.
# If JASKL should be shadowed into the JAR file, enable jasklShadow.
jasklVersion = 1.4.0
jasklImplementation = hocon
jasklShadow = false

# Gradle settings
projectGroup = net.kettlemc
javaSourceVersion = 8

## ‚ûï Additional Information
As this template has been created for KettleMC.net, most of the settings are already set up for KettleMC.net. If you want to use this template for your own project, you should change the settings to your liking.

By default, the plugin contains JASKL, a library for creating configuration files. If you don't want to use JASKL, simply disable it in the gradle.properties file.
